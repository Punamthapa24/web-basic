        <h2>Welcome to Day 3</h2>
        <p>Here we discuss about bootstrap and it's uses.</p>
        <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
        <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used to create responsive 
            and mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed initially by Twitter, it's designed to simplify the web development process by providing pre-designed templates, components, and styles.
            It is like a ready-made toolkit for building websites. It gives you pre-designed blocks (like buttons, menus, and layouts) and a flexible grid to easily arrange content. Plus, it makes your website 
            look good on phones, tablets, and computers without much extra work. It's like having a shortcut to design a professional-looking site quickly!</p>
        <h2>Why bootstrap was introduced?</h2>
        <p>Bootstrap was introduced to solve common challenges web developers faced, such as inconsistent designs and a lack of tools for responsive websites. 
            Before Bootstrap, creating websites that looked good across different devices (like computers, tablets, and phones) was tedious and time-consuming.</p>
        <h5>Hereâ€™s why it was introduced:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure uniform design and functionality across web projects, especially for teams working together.</li>
            <li>To save time by providing ready-made components and a framework to build websites faster.</li>
            <li>To make it easy for websites to adapt to different screen sizes without extra effort.</li>
            <li>To ensure websites looked and worked the same in all modern browsers.</li>
           </ul> 
       
        <p> If you want to use bootstrap in your HTML file.</p>
       
            <li>First you have to add bootstrap to your project by linking its CDN in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML:</li>
            <img src="../Images/Screenshot17.png" alt="">
            <li>Then, you can use it by using their pre-built components.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is college design we have build in day 3:</p>
        <!-- Embed the College.html file -->
        <iframe src="../college.html" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="600px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        <p>Here we build registration form</p>
        <!-- Embed the Register.html file -->
        <iframe src="../Registerr.html" frameborder="0" height="500px" width="600px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
