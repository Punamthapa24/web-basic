    <h2>Welcome to Day 8</h2>
    <p>Here we discuss about OOP.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First of all we make a new file with the name of 'Room.cs' in Consoleapp directory.
            In this we define some fields.
        </li>
        <pre>
                <code>
                  public class Room
                    {
                        public double widthFt;
                        public double lengthFt;
                        public double heigthFT;
                        public string paintColor;   
                        public byte floor;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <li>Then in another file 'program.cs' we make new method() to call 'Room' fieldset.</li>
            <pre>
                Room r1 = new Room();
                r1.paintColor = "Green";
                r1.floor = 3;
                r1.lengthFt = 15.5;
                r1.widthFt = 12.4;
                r1.heigthFT = 8;
                var info = $"Hey guys we have a room in floor {floor} which is painted {paintColor}. It's dimension is {lengthFt}x{widthFt}x{heigthFT}.";
                Console.WriteLine(info);
            </pre>   
            <li>There is another way to call it's field by using parameterized constructor. Inside the 'Room' class we have to pass argument
                in constructor in 'Room.cs' file:
            </li>
            <pre>
                public Room(string color, byte f, double l, double w, double h)
                {
                    paintColor = color;
                    floor = f;
                    lengthFt = l;
                    widthFt = w;
                    heigthFT = h;
                }
            </pre>
            <li>To display above code we have to make new method to call this information in 'Room.cs':</li>
            <pre>
                public void DisplayInfo()
                {
                    var info = $"Hey guys we have a room in floor {floor} which is painted {paintColor}. It's dimension is {lengthFt}x{widthFt}x{heigthFT}.";
                    Console.WriteLine(info);
                }
            </pre>
            <li>We also inherit the features of one class from another class. Here we inherit the features of 'Room'
                for 'HotelRoom'. So, make another class with name 'HotelRoom.cs'.
            </li>
            <pre>
                public class HotelRoom : Room
                {

                }
            </pre>
            <li>To enable this inherit features we have to add default constructor in 'Room.cs' within the class.</li>
            <pre>
                public Room1(){

                }
            </pre>
            <li>'HotelRoom' class can have additional features, so we can add additional fields in it.</li>
            <pre>
                public class HotelRoom : Room1{
                    public byte beds;
                    public bool hasAC;
                    public bool attachedWashroom;
                }
            </pre>
        </ul>          
</body>
