        <h2>Welcome to Day 7</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><h3>Here we learn about C# where we explore about "How to work with strings?", 
            TrimStart(), TrimEnd(), Trim() and many more.</h3></li>
        <h5>For example:</h5>
        <p>This is the example of <b>Work with strings</b></p>

        <p>You can also write this by another way. <b>Example:</b></p>
        <img src="../Images/Screenshot25.png" alt="">
        <p>The output should be same for both code.(i.e. My friends are Maria and Sage)</p>
        <li><h3>After this we use branches and loops.</h3></li>
        <img src="../Images/Screenshot26.png" alt="">
        <p>We can also run this code by different way. <b>For Example:</b></p>
        <img src="../Images/Screenshot27.png" alt="">
        <p>OR</p>
        <img src="../Images/Screenshot28.png" alt="">
        <li><h3>And then we learn how to make calculation and how to print numbers by using c#.</h3></li>
        <p>Here is some snapshots of divider and printing numbers.</p>

        <img src="../Images/Screenshot30.png" alt="">
        <li><h3>Here is simple example of looping to print numbers from 1 to 100:</h3></li>
        <img src="../Images/Screenshot31.png" alt="">
        <p> Here we write "Console.Write()" only because if we use "Console.WriteLine()", the numbers will shown in one by one line but if we use 
            "Console.Write()" your numbers will shown on one line orderly.</p>
