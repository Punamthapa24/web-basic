    <h1>Welcome to Day 5</h1>
    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that brings websites to life. It enables interactive features like
        animations, form
        validations, and dynamic content updates. It's versatile, running on both web browsers and servers (with
        Node.js), and forms
        the foundation of modern web development alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h2>Why JavaScript was introduced?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape to bring interactively and dynamic behaviour to web
        pages.</p>
    <h4>Hereâ€™s some reasons why JavaScript was introduced:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Interactivity:</h3>To enable features like buttons, forms, and animations that respond to user actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Client-Side Functionality:</h3>To offload tasks from the server to the browser, improving performance
            and reducing server load.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Ease of Use:</h3>To provide a simple programming language that could be understood and used by
            non-programmers, making web development more accessible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cross-Platform Support:</h3>To work across different operating systems and browsers without requiring
            additional software.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here we print numbers from 1-500.</p>
    <pre>
            let titleH1 = document.getElementById("title");
            titleH1.style.color = "green";
            titleH1.style.fontFamily = "Helvetica";
            titleH1.innerText = "Numbers from 1 to 500" ;
            let numbersDiv = document.getElementById("numbers");
         let numbersHtml = "";
         for (let i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {
             numbersHtml = numbersHtml + "&lt;h2&gt;  class='badge text-bg-danger'>"+i+"&lt;/h2&gt;";
         }
         numbersDiv.innerHTML = numbersHtml;
         
        </pre>
        <p>Here we print numbers from 1-upto. </p>
        <pre>
            let titleH1 = document.getElementById("title");
titleH1.style.color = "green";
titleH1.style.fontFamily = "Helvetica";

function printNumbers(){
   let upto = document.getElementById("UpperRange").value
   titleH1.innerText = "Numbers from 1 to" + upto;
   let numbersDiv = document.getElementById("numbers");
let numbersHtml = "";
for (let i = 1; i <= upto; i++) {
    numbersHtml = numbersHtml + "&lt;h2&gt;  class='badge text-bg-danger'>"+i+"&lt;/h2&gt;";
}
numbersDiv.innerHTML = numbersHtml;
