        <h1>Welcome to Day 9</h1>
        <p>Here we discuss about the ASP.NET MVC and build project in this framework.</p>
        <h2>About ASP.NET MVC</h2>
        <p>ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework developed by microsoft, which follows the model-view-controller(MVC)
            architectural pattern.</p>
        <p>Application into three interconnected components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model: Represents the application's data and business logic.</li>
            <li>View: Responsible for displaying the user interface and presenting data from the model.</li>
            <li>Controller: Manages user input, updates the model, and returns the appropriate view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Razor View Engine is used because it provide a clean, efficient, and developer-friendly way to create dynamic web pages in
            ASP.NET MVC framework:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First we make directory with WebApp in BackendBasics which is in the main folder 'WEBBSICS'. Here
                we are</li>
                <img src="../Images/Screenshot32.png" alt="">
                <li>The navigate the project folder:</li>
                <img src="../Images/Screenshot34.png" alt="">
                <li>Then run the project locally:'dotnet run' command.</li>
                <img src="../Images/Screenshot33.png" alt="">
                <li>We use 'dotnet watch' to detect chamge manually restart the application.</li>
                <li>Once the application starts there we can see URL where the app is hosted simply by click(ctrl+click)
                    in this URL.</li>
                    <li>Then we can see our application running in the web browser.</li>
                    <li>Let's explore the folder structure in this we application.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Controller: Handle incoming user requests, process them, and determine how to respond.</li>
                        <li>View: It presenting the data to users in an engaging and user-friendly way.</li>
                        <li>Models: It representing the core logic and data of your application.</li>
                        <li>WWW.root: It housing static files like images, CSS, and Javascript that the browser can directly
                            access.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>If we are building tutorial application, we go to controller directory which is already build, name
                        the files tutorialController.cs</li>
                        <li>Then go to views, make a folder whcih related to the tutorialController as: Tutorial</li>
                        <li>In Controller folder, choose tutorialController and chnages the action method we want to kept.</li>
                        <li>After this, go to Tutorial in the 'views' and named the action method mention in the tutorialController.</li>
                        <li>To see the result save the files and in the terminal performs: Dotnet watch</li>
        </ol>
